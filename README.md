## **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/globetrotter-game.git
  cd globetrotter-game
```

### **2. Backend Setup**

#### Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
  cd backend
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

#### Start the backend server:
```bash
  npm start
```

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### **3. Frontend Setup**

#### Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
  cd ../frontend
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

#### Start the frontend application:
```bash
  npm start
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Running the Application**

1. **Start MongoDB** (if using local MongoDB, ensure itâ€™s running):
```bash
  mongod
```

2. **Run the backend server:**
```bash
  cd backend
  npm start
```

3. **Run the frontend application:**
```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and start playing!

## **Deployment**

### **Backend Deployment**
1. Deploy the backend to platforms like **Heroku, Render, or AWS**.
2. Update the `MONGO_URI` to a cloud database like MongoDB Atlas.
3. Set the environment variables in your hosting platform.

### **Frontend Deployment**
1. Deploy the frontend using **Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting**.
2. Update the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in the `.env` file to point to the deployed backend.
3. Build the project:
```bash
  npm run build
```
4. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting platform.
